>
> This product is **NOT YET RELEASED** and is currently in active development.
> - Features may be incomplete or unstable
> - Breaking changes may occur without notice
> - **ALWAYS backup your CODESYS project before using these scripts**
> - Test thoroughly in non-production environments first

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for **CODESYS** that facilitate two modern Git-based workflows:

### 1. 🔍 Monitor & History (The "Observer" Workflow)
- **Goal**: Track the work of different engineers and maintain a granular history of project changes.
- **Method**: Exports the entire project—including Visualizations, Alarms, Task Configs, and Project Info—to **Native XML** files.
- **Benefit**: Even binary-heavy parts of the project become visible in Git, allowing you to see *who* changed *what* and *when*, directly in your version control system. Changes made inside the CODESYS IDE are captured and stored safely.

### 2. ⚡ External Editing & Sync (The "Developer" Workflow)
- **Goal**: Edit code using modern external tools (VS Code, Copilot/LLMs) and sync changes back to CODESYS.
- **Method**: Exports logic (POUs, GVLs, DUTs) to clean **Structured Text (.st)** files.
- **Benefit**: You can refactor code, use AI assistants, or mass-edit variables externally. The `Project_import.py` script then seamlessly updates your open CODESYS project with the new logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid Export**: Choose between "Code Only" (ST) for development or "Full Project" (ST + XML) for archival and history tracking.
- **Git Friendly**: Organizes all exports into a clean folder structure matching your project tree.
- **Smart Metadata**: Uses GUIDs to ensure reliable syncing even if you rename or move objects.
- **Reversible Sync**: Round-trip editing for Structured Text files.
- **Safety**: Built-in checks to prevent overwriting the wrong project.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all `.py` files to the CODESYS scripts directory:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\CODESYS\ScriptDir\`

2. **Access in CODESYS**:
   - The scripts will be available in **Tools > Scripting > Scripts > P**.
   - Note: They appear in the "P" sub-menu because they all start with `Project_`.

3. **Add to Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Customize > Toolbars**.
   - Select **Standard** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Add Command**.
   - Look for **ScriptEngine Commands > P**.
   - Add the desired scripts to your toolbar for one-click access.

## 📖 Script Overview

### Core Scripts

#### 1. `Project_directory.py`
**The First Step.** Run this to select the folder on your computer where your code should be synced. This creates a `BASE_DIR` file in the script directory to remember your choice.

#### 2. `Project_export.py`
Exports the current CODESYS project to the selected directory.
- Creates `.st` files for all POUs, Methods, Actions, Properties, GVLs, and DUTs.
- Generates a `_metadata.json` file with project info, sync settings, and object mappings.
- **Safety Check**: Warns if exporting to a directory containing a different project's files.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not delete `_metadata.json`, as it's required for importing.

#### 3. `Project_import.py`
Reads the `.st` files in your sync directory and updates the CODESYS project.
- Matches files to CODESYS objects using the metadata.
- **Untracked File Warning**: If you create new `.st` files or folders directly in the file system, the script will skip them and warn you with a popup list after importing.
- **Warning**: This will overwrite the code in your open CODESYS project. Always have a backup!

#### 4. `Project_ImportSync.py`
Auto-synchronize external file changes to CODESYS (one-way: Folder → IDE).
- Monitors exported `.st` files for changes
- Automatically updates CODESYS objects when files are modified
- Configurable sync interval via `Project_parameters.py`
- Run once to START, run again to STOP

#### 5. `Project_parameters.py`
Configuration hub for the toolset.
- **Sync Timeout**: Set the check interval for AutoSync (2s - 30s).
- **XML Export**: Toggle Native XML export ON/OFF.
  - **ON**: Exports Visualizations, Alarms, TextLists, etc., for full project history.
  - **OFF**: Exports only ST code for faster, cleaner external development.

#### 6. `Erase_comments_add_Header.py`
Utility to remove comments and add copyright headers to exported files.

### Shared Modules

#### `codesys_constants.py`
Central repository for CODESYS type GUIDs and constants.
- Defines `EXPORTABLE_TYPES` (ST) and `XML_TYPES` (Native XML)

#### `codesys_utils.py`
Common utility functions used across all scripts.

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### For Version Control & History:
1.  Open **`Project_parameters.py`** and **Enable XML Export**.
2.  Run **`Project_export.py`**.
3.  Commit the result to Git. You now have a snapshot of your entire project, including HMI and configuration.

### For External Development:
1.  Open **`Project_parameters.py`** and **Disable XML Export** (or leave it auto-disabled after the first run).
2.  Run **`Project_export.py`**.
3.  Open the `.st` files in VS Code / Cursor to edit logic.
4.  Run **`Project_import.py`** (or AutoSync) to push logic changes back to the PLC.

**Why different modes?**
- **XML** files are great for history but can be complex to merge or edit manually.
- **ST** files are perfect for editing but don't capture the visual layout of an HMI screen.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **⚠️ BETA STATUS**: This software is in active development. **Always backup your project** before using any script.
- **Metadata**: The `_metadata.json` file contains project info and object mappings. You can manually edit sync settings if needed, but don't modify the `objects` section.
- **Backups**: Always save a `.project` backup before running an import.
- **Creating New Blocks**: The best workflow is to **create the block name in CODESYS IDE first**, export it, and then fill the content externally. Creating files manually in the folder system will trigger a warning during import because they lack metadata.

## 📝 Changelog

### Version 0.9.2-beta (2026-01-20)

**Major Refactoring:**
- Extracted common code into shared modules (`codesys_constants.py` and `codesys_utils.py`)
- Reduced code duplication by ~300 lines across 5 scripts
- Centralized CODESYS type GUIDs and constants
- Improved maintainability and consistency

**Bug Fixes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed `build_object_cache()` not finding objects when called from imported modules
  - Issue: Imported modules don't have access to CODESYS global variables (`projects`)
  - Solution: Modified function to accept project as parameter
  - Impact: Import and AutoSync now work correctly
- Updated all scripts to pass `projects.primary` to `build_object_cache()`

**New Files:**
- `codesys_constants.py` - Shared constants and type definitions
- `codesys_utils.py` - Shared utility functions
- `debug_metadata.py` - Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed refactoring documentation
