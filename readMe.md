This repository contains a set of Python scripts for **CODESYS** that enable a reversible, text-based workflow for project development. It allows you to export your CODESYS project code to a structured folder system, edit it using modern tools (like VS Code or LLMs), and import the changes back into CODESYS.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Reversible Sync**: Round-trip export and import of POUs, GVLs, and DUTs.
- **Git Friendly**: Exports code to standard `.st` (Structured Text) files organized by project hierarchy.
- **Metadata-Driven**: Uses GUIDs and metadata to ensure reliable updates even if objects are moved or renamed in the project.
- **Safety Checks**: Project identity verification on export.
- **Modular Architecture**: Shared constants and utilities for easier maintenance.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all `.py` files to the CODESYS scripts directory:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\CODESYS\ScriptDir\`

2. **Access in CODESYS**:
   - The scripts will be available in **Tools > Scripting > Scripts > P**.
   - Note: They appear in the "P" sub-menu because they all start with `Project_`.

3. **Add to Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Customize > Toolbars**.
   - Select **Standard** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Add Command**.
   - Look for **ScriptEngine Commands > P**.
   - Add the desired scripts to your toolbar for one-click access.

## 📖 Script Overview

### Core Scripts

#### 1. `Project_directory.py`
**The First Step.** Run this to select the folder on your computer where your code should be synced. This creates a `BASE_DIR` file in the script directory to remember your choice.

#### 2. `Project_export.py`
Exports the current CODESYS project to the selected directory.
- Creates `.st` files for all POUs, Methods, Actions, Properties, GVLs, and DUTs.
- Generates a `_metadata.json` file with project info, sync settings, and object mappings.
- **Safety Check**: Warns if exporting to a directory containing a different project's files.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not delete `_metadata.json`, as it's required for importing.

#### 3. `Project_import.py`
Reads the `.st` files in your sync directory and updates the CODESYS project.
- Matches files to CODESYS objects using the metadata.
- **Untracked File Warning**: If you create new `.st` files or folders directly in the file system, the script will skip them and warn you with a popup list after importing.
- **Warning**: This will overwrite the code in your open CODESYS project. Always have a backup!

#### 4. `Project_ImportSync.py`
Auto-synchronize external file changes to CODESYS (one-way: Folder → IDE).
- Monitors exported `.st` files for changes
- Automatically updates CODESYS objects when files are modified
- Configurable sync interval via `Project_set_sync_timeout.py`
- Run once to START, run again to STOP

#### 5. `Project_set_sync_timeout.py`
Configure the sync check interval for AutoSync.
- Offers predefined timeout options (2s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 30s)
- Updates timeout settings in `_metadata.json`
- Changes apply immediately if AutoSync is running

#### 6. `Erase_comments_add_Header.py`
Utility to remove comments and add copyright headers to exported files.

### Shared Modules

#### `codesys_constants.py`
Central repository for CODESYS type GUIDs and constants.
- TYPE_GUIDS dictionary
- EXPORTABLE_TYPES list
- IMPL_MARKER constant
- Other shared constants

#### `codesys_utils.py`
Common utility functions used across all scripts.
- File parsing and metadata handling
- Object caching and lookup
- Base directory management
- Safe string conversion

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

1. **Configure**: Run `Project_directory.py` and select your local Git repository folder.
2. **Export**: Run `Project_export.py`.
3. **Commit**: Use Git to track your changes.
4. **Edit**: Open the `.st` files in your favorite editor (VS Code, etc.) and make changes.
   - **Tip**: If you need a new POU/GVL, create it (even as an empty block) in **CODESYS IDE first**, then run Export. This ensures the object has a valid GUID in the metadata.
5. **Review**: Use Git to review your edits.
6. **Import**: Run `Project_import.py` in CODESYS to bring the changes back into the PLC environment.

**Alternative**: Use `Project_ImportSync.py` for automatic synchronization while editing.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **⚠️ BETA STATUS**: This software is in active development. **Always backup your project** before using any script.
- **Metadata**: The `_metadata.json` file contains project info and object mappings. You can manually edit sync settings if needed, but don't modify the `objects` section.
- **Backups**: Always save a `.project` backup before running an import.
- **Creating New Blocks**: The best workflow is to **create the block name in CODESYS IDE first**, export it, and then fill the content externally. Creating files manually in the folder system will trigger a warning during import because they lack metadata.
