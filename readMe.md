> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ BETA SOFTWARE - USE WITH CAUTION ⚠️**
>
> This product is **NOT YET RELEASED** and is currently in active development.
> - Features may be incomplete or unstable
> - Breaking changes may occur without notice
> - **ALWAYS backup your CODESYS project before using these scripts**
> - Test thoroughly in non-production environments first

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for **CODESYS** that facilitate two modern Git-based workflows:

### 1. 🔍 Monitor & History (The "Observer" Workflow)
- **Goal**: Track the work of different engineers and maintain a granular history of project changes.
- **Method**: Exports the entire project—including Visualizations, Alarms, Task Configs, and Project Info—to **Native XML** files.
- **Benefit**: Even binary-heavy parts of the project become visible in Git, allowing you to see *who* changed *what* and *when*, directly in your version control system. Changes made inside the CODESYS IDE are captured and stored safely.

### 2. ⚡ External Editing & Sync (The "Developer" Workflow)
- **Goal**: Edit code using modern external tools (VS Code, Copilot/LLMs) and sync changes back to CODESYS.
- **Method**: Exports logic (POUs, GVLs, DUTs) to clean **Structured Text (.st)** files.
- **Benefit**: You can refactor code, use AI assistants, or mass-edit variables externally. The `Project_import.py` script then seamlessly updates your open CODESYS project with the new logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hybrid Export**: Choose between "Code Only" (ST) for development or "Full Project" (ST + XML) for archival and history tracking.
- **Git Friendly**: Organizes all exports into a clean folder structure matching your project tree.
- **Smart Metadata**: Uses GUIDs to ensure reliable syncing even if you rename or move objects.
- **Reversible Sync**: Round-trip editing for Structured Text files.
- **Safety**: Built-in checks to prevent overwriting the wrong project.
- **Bi-directional Deletion**: Keep your file system and CODESYS project in sync by removing orphaned files or objects.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all `.py` files to the CODESYS scripts directory:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\CODESYS\ScriptDir\`

2. **Access in CODESYS**:
   - The scripts will be available in **Tools > Scripting > Scripts > P**.
   - Note: They appear in the "P" sub-menu because they all start with `Project_`.

3. **Add to Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Customize > Toolbars**.
   - Select **Standard** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Add Command**.
   - Look for **ScriptEngine Commands > P**.
   - Add the desired scripts to your toolbar for one-click access.

## 📖 Script Overview

### Core Scripts

#### 1. `Project_directory.py`
**The First Step.** Run this to select the folder on your computer where your code should be synced. This creates a `BASE_DIR` file in the script directory to remember your choice.

#### 2. `Project_export.py`
Exports the current CODESYS project to the selected directory.
- Creates `.st` files for all POUs, Methods, Actions, Properties, GVLs, and DUTs.
- Generates a `_metadata.json` file with project info, sync settings, and object mappings.
- **Safety Check**: Warns if exporting to a directory containing a different project's files.
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Detects and offers to delete files on disk that no longer exist in the CODESYS project.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not delete `_metadata.json`, as it's required for importing.

#### 3. `Project_import.py`
Reads the `.st` files in your sync directory and updates the CODESYS project.
- **Smart Update**: Matches existing files to CODESYS objects using metadata.
- **New Creation**: Automatically creates new Folders, POUs, GVLs, and DUTs found in the file system.
- **Child Objects**: Supports creating Methods, Actions, and Properties (e.g., `MyPOU.MyAction.st`).
- **Warning**: This will overwrite the code in your open CODESYS project. Always have a backup!
- **Sync Deletions**: If you delete a file on disk, the importer will offer to delete the corresponding object in CODESYS.

#### 4. `Project_ImportSync.py`
Auto-synchronize external file changes to CODESYS (one-way: Folder → IDE).
- Monitors exported `.st` files for changes
- Automatically updates CODESYS objects when files are modified
- Configurable sync interval via `Project_parameters.py`
- Run once to START, run again to STOP

#### 5. `Project_parameters.py`
Configuration hub for the toolset.
- **Sync Timeout**: Set the check interval for AutoSync (2s - 30s).
- **XML Export**: Toggle Native XML export ON/OFF.
  - **ON**: Exports Visualizations, Alarms, TextLists, etc., for full project history.
  - **OFF**: Exports only ST code for faster, cleaner external development.



### Shared Modules

#### `codesys_constants.py`
Central repository for CODESYS type GUIDs and constants.
- Defines `EXPORTABLE_TYPES` (ST) and `XML_TYPES` (Native XML)

#### `codesys_utils.py`
Common utility functions used across all scripts.

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### For Version Control & History:
1.  Open **`Project_parameters.py`** and **Enable XML Export**.
2.  Run **`Project_export.py`**.
3.  Commit the result to Git. You now have a snapshot of your entire project, including HMI and configuration.

### For External Development:
1.  Open **`Project_parameters.py`** and **Disable XML Export** (or leave it auto-disabled after the first run).
2.  Run **`Project_export.py`**.
3.  Open the `.st` files in VS Code / Cursor to edit logic.
4.  Run **`Project_import.py`** (or AutoSync) to push logic changes back to the PLC.

**Why different modes?**
- **XML** files are great for history but can be complex to merge or edit manually.
- **ST** files are perfect for editing but don't capture the visual layout of an HMI screen.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **⚠️ BETA STATUS**: This software is in active development. **Always backup your project** before using any script.
- **Metadata**: The `_metadata.json` file contains project info and object mappings. You can manually edit sync settings if needed, but don't modify the `objects` section.
- **Backups**: Always save a `.project` backup before running an import.
- **Creating New Blocks**: You can now create new `.st` files and folders directly in your OS. The import script will automatically create the corresponding objects (POUs, GVLs, Folders) in CODESYS.

## 📝 Changelog

### Version 0.9.8-beta (2026-01-29)

**New Features & Improvements:**
- **Orphan Cleanup (Export)**: `Project_export.py` now identifies files in the export directory that are no longer part of the CODESYS project and offers to delete them.
- **Deletion Sync (Import)**: `Project_import.py` now detects when files have been removed from disk and offers to delete the matching objects from the CODESYS IDE.
- **Empty Folder Management**: Automatic cleanup of empty directories during the export process.

### Version 0.9.7-beta (2026-01-20)

**New Features & Improvements:**
- **Function Return Types**: The import script now intelligently parses `FUNCTION` declarations to determine return types (including custom DUTs) and creates them correctly.
- **Property Accessors**: Added support for `Get.st` and `Set.st` files, ensuring they are correctly associated with their parent Properties.
- **Robust Type Detection**: Improved parsing logic to ignore comments and pragmas when determining object types, fixing issues with file headers.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved "Access Denied" errors by properly skipping directory checks in the file processing loop.

### Version 0.9.6-beta (2026-01-20)

**New Features:**
- **Full Folder Support**: The importer now creates new folder structures (nested directories) to match your file system.
- **New Object Creation**: You can create `.st` files externally, and they will be imported as new POUs, GVLs, or DUTs.
- **Child Object Support**: Methods, Actions, and Properties (e.g., `Parent.Child.st`) are now correctly identified and created under their parent POU.
- **Robust Import**: Implemented a two-pass import process (Parents then Children) to ensure 100% reliable object creation.

### Version 0.9.2-beta (2026-01-20)

**Major Refactoring:**
- Extracted common code into shared modules (`codesys_constants.py` and `codesys_utils.py`)
- Reduced code duplication by ~300 lines across 5 scripts
- Centralized CODESYS type GUIDs and constants
- Improved maintainability and consistency

**Bug Fixes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed `build_object_cache()` not finding objects when called from imported modules
  - Issue: Imported modules don't have access to CODESYS global variables (`projects`)
  - Solution: Modified function to accept project as parameter
  - Impact: Import and AutoSync now work correctly
- Updated all scripts to pass `projects.primary` to `build_object_cache()`

**New Files:**
