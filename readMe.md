This repository contains a set of Python scripts for **CODESYS** that enable a reversible, text-based workflow for project development. It allows you to export your CODESYS project code to a structured folder system, edit it using modern tools (like VS Code or LLMs), and import the changes back into CODESYS.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Reversible Sync**: Round-trip export and import of POUs, GVLs, and DUTs.
- **Git Friendly**: Exports code to standard `.st` (Structured Text) files organized by project hierarchy.
- **Metadata-Driven**: Uses GUIDs and metadata to ensure reliable updates even if objects are moved or renamed in the project.
- **Auto-Sync**: Optional background monitoring to automatically sync external file changes to CODESYS IDE.
- **Safety Checks**: Project identity verification and automatic sync stopping on project changes.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all `.py` files to the CODESYS scripts directory:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\CODESYS\ScriptDir\`

2. **Access in CODESYS**:
   - The scripts will be available in **Tools > Scripting > Scripts > P**.
   - Note: They appear in the "P" sub-menu because they all start with `Project_`.

3. **Add to Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Customize > Toolbars**.
   - Select **Standard** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Add Command**.
   - Look for **ScriptEngine Commands > P**.
   - Add the desired scripts to your toolbar for one-click access.

## 📖 Script Overview

### 1. `Project_directory.py`
**The First Step.** Run this to select the folder on your computer where your code should be synced. This creates a `BASE_DIR` file in the script directory to remember your choice.

### 2. `Project_export.py`
Exports the current CODESYS project to the selected directory.
- Creates `.st` files for all POUs, Methods, Actions, Properties, GVLs, and DUTs.
- Generates a `_metadata.json` file with project info, sync settings, and object mappings.
- **Safety Check**: Warns if exporting to a directory containing a different project's files.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not delete `_metadata.json`, as it's required for importing and AutoSync.

### 3. `Project_import.py`
Reads the `.st` files in your sync directory and updates the CODESYS project.
- Matches files to CODESYS objects using the metadata.
- **Untracked File Warning**: If you create new `.st` files or folders directly in the file system, the script will skip them and warn you with a popup list after importing.
- **Warning**: This will overwrite the code in your open CODESYS project. Always have a backup!

### 4. `Project_AutoSync.py` ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL**
Automatically monitors your exported `.st` files and syncs changes back to CODESYS in real-time.
- **One-way sync**: Folder → IDE only (external edits update CODESYS)
- Runs in the background without blocking the IDE
- **State stored in `_metadata.json`**: `autosync` (RUNNING/STOPPED) and `sync_timeout` (milliseconds)
- **Default interval**: 10 seconds (10000ms)
- **Usage**: Run once to START, run again to STOP
- **Safety checks**: Stops automatically if metadata is missing or project changes
- **Dynamic updates**: Timeout changes apply immediately on next cycle
- **Workflow**: Create blocks in IDE → Export → Start AutoSync → Edit files externally
- **⚠️ CAUTION**: This is an experimental feature. Monitor the CODESYS Messages view for sync status.

### 5. `Project_set_sync_timeout.py`
Configure the AutoSync check interval.
- Offers predefined timeout options (2s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 30s)
- Updates `sync_timeout` in `_metadata.json`
- **Changes apply immediately** if AutoSync is running (no restart needed)

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

1. **Configure**: Run `Project_directory.py` and select your local Git repository folder.
2. **Export**: Run `Project_export.py`.
3. **Commit**: Use Git to track your changes.
4. **Edit**: Open the `.st` files in your favorite editor (VS Code, etc.) and make changes.
   - **Tip**: If you need a new POU/GVL, create it (even as an empty block) in **CODESYS IDE first**, then run Export. This ensures the object has a valid GUID in the metadata.
5. **Review**: Use Git to review your edits.
6. **Import**: Run `Project_import.py` in CODESYS to bring the changes back into the PLC environment.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **⚠️ BETA STATUS**: This software is in active development. **Always backup your project** before using any script.
- **Metadata**: The `_metadata.json` file contains project info, sync settings, and object mappings. You can manually edit `autosync` and `sync_timeout` if needed, but don't modify the `objects` section.
- **Backups**: Always save a `.project` backup before running an import.
- **Creating New Blocks**: The best workflow is to **create the block name in CODESYS IDE first**, export it, and then fill the content externally. Creating files manually in the folder system will trigger a warning during import because they lack metadata.
- **AutoSync Experimental**: The `Project_AutoSync.py` script is experimental. If you experience issues, stop the sync and use manual export/import workflow instead.
