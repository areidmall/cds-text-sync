This repository contains a set of Python scripts for **CODESYS** that facilitate two modern Git-based workflows:

### 2. ⚡ External Editing & Sync (The "Developer" Workflow)
- **Goal**: Edit code using modern external tools (VS Code, Copilot/LLMs) and sync changes back to CODESYS.
- **Method**: Exports logic (POUs, GVLs, DUTs) to clean **Structured Text (.st)** files.
- **Benefit**: You can refactor code, use AI assistants, or mass-edit variables externally. The `Project_import.py` script then seamlessly updates your open CODESYS project with the new logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Reversible Sync**: Round-trip editing for Structured Text files.
- **Safety**: Built-in checks to prevent overwriting the wrong project.
- **Bi-directional Deletion**: Keep your file system and CODESYS project in sync by removing orphaned files or objects.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all `.py` files to the CODESYS scripts directory:
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\CODESYS\ScriptDir\`

2. **Access in CODESYS**:
   - The scripts will be available in **Tools > Scripting > Scripts > P**.
   - Note: They appear in the "P" sub-menu because they all start with `Project_`.

3. **Add to Toolbar (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Go to **Tools > Customize > Toolbars**.
   - Select **Standard** (or create a new one).
   - Click **Add Command**.
   - Look for **ScriptEngine Commands > P**.
   - Add the desired scripts to your toolbar for one-click access.

## 📖 Script Overview

### Core Scripts

#### 1. `Project_directory.py`
**The First Step.** Run this to select the folder where the project sync will take place. 
- Requires an open project.
- Saves the path strictly to **Project Information > Properties** (`cds-sync-folder`).
- This binds the sync folder to the specific CODESYS project file.

#### 2. `Project_export.py`
Exports the current CODESYS project to the selected directory.
- Creates `.st` files for all POUs, Methods, Actions, Properties, GVLs, and DUTs.
- Generates `_config.json` and `_metadata.csv` files with project info, sync settings, and object mappings.
- **Safety Check**: Warns if exporting to a directory containing a different project's files.
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Detects and offers to delete files on disk that no longer exist in the CODESYS project.
- **Library Export**: Saves all project libraries and their versions to `_libraries.csv` for version control.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not delete metadata files, as they are required for importing.

#### 3. `Project_import.py`
Reads the `.st` files in your sync directory and updates the CODESYS project.
- **Smart Update**: Matches existing files to CODESYS objects using metadata.
- **New Creation**: Automatically creates new Folders, POUs, GVLs, and DUTs found in the file system.
- **Child Objects**: Supports creating Methods, Actions, and Properties (e.g., `MyPOU.MyAction.st`).
- **Warning**: This will overwrite the code in your open CODESYS project. Always have a backup!
- **Sync Deletions**: If you delete a file on disk, the importer will offer to delete the corresponding object in CODESYS.
- **Library Sync**: Detects missing libraries or version mismatches against `_libraries.csv` and offers to update the CODESYS project.

#### 3. `Project_parameters.py`
Configure sync parameters for the **current project**.
- Allows changing the sync timeout and toggling XML export.
- All changes are saved directly to **Project Information > Properties**.

### ⏳ Planned / Experimental (Currently Unavailable)

#### `Project_ImportSync.py` (AutoSync)
⚠️ **Currently Unavailable / Experimental.**
A script for automatic change monitoring. Version 1.1.0-beta is undergoing refactoring to align with the new project properties logic.



### Shared Modules

#### `codesys_constants.py`
Central repository for CODESYS type GUIDs and constants.
- Defines `EXPORTABLE_TYPES` (ST) and `XML_TYPES` (Native XML)

#### `codesys_utils.py`
Common utility functions used across all scripts.

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

1.  Run **`Project_export.py`**.
2.  Open the `.st` files in VS Code / Cursor to edit logic.
3.  Run **`Project_import.py`** to push logic changes back to the PLC.

**Why focus on ST?**
Structured Text files are perfect for editing, refactoring, and AI assistance. They provide a clean representation of the project logic that is easy to manage in Git.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **⚠️ BETA STATUS**: This software is in active development. **Always backup your project** before using any script.
- **Metadata**: Project settings are stored in `_config.json` and object mappings in `_metadata.csv`. Don't modify the CSV file manually.
- **Library Tracking**: Library versions are stored in `_libraries.csv` for version control.
- **CRITICAL**: `_libraries.csv` is a machine-generated file. **DO NOT MODIFY IT MANUALLY**. Any manual changes will be overwritten during the next export.
- **Library Sync Limitations**: The import script detects version mismatches. If the script reports differences, you MUST update libraries manually via the CODESYS Library Manager to match the versions in the CSV.
- **Metadata Versioning**: If you update these scripts, you MUST perform a fresh **Export from IDE** to regenerate the metadata. It is recommended to clean the export folder first.
- **Backups**: Always save a `.project` backup before running an import.
- **Creating New Blocks**: You can now create new `.st` files and folders directly in your OS. The import script will automatically create the corresponding objects (POUs, GVLs, Folders) in CODESYS.

## 📚 Library Version Control

The `_libraries.csv` file tracks all library dependencies and their versions. This enables:
- **Version consistency** across different project instances
- **Git-based tracking** of library changes
- **Automatic detection** of version mismatches during import

### File Format

```csv
Name;Version;Company;Namespace;IsPlaceholder
Standard;3.5.18.0;System;Standard;True
FloatingPointUtils;4.0.0.0;System;FloatingPointUtils;True
SM3_Basic;4.20.0.0;CODESYS;SM3_Basic;True
```

### How It Works

1. **Export**: `Project_export.py` extracts current library versions (preferring manually selected versions over wildcards) and saves them to `_libraries.csv`.
2. **Version Control**: Commit `_libraries.csv` to Git to track dependency changes.
3. **Import**: `Project_import.py` compares the CSV with the IDE state and warns about missing or mismatched versions.
4. **Manual Sync**: If warned, open Library Manager and update libraries to the specific versions listed in the CSV.

## 📝 Changelog

### Version 1.1.0-beta (2026-01-30)

**Full Project Integration (Project-Bound Config):**
- **Source of Truth**: All synchronization settings (`folder`, `timeout`, `xml_export`, `timestamp`) are now stored within the `.project` file under **Project Information > Properties** using the `cds-sync-` prefix.
- **Portability**: Sync settings are preserved when the project file is moved to another computer.
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed dependence on the global `BASE_DIR` file and local `_config.json` as the sole source of settings.
- **Mirroring**: Configuration is mirrored to JSON files during export for compatibility with external tools.
- **AutoSync Status**: The automatic sync script is temporarily disabled to focus on the stability of the core engine.

### Version 1.0.0-beta (2026-01-30)

**Reliability & Performance Milestone:**
- **Dynamic Parent Resolution**: Newly created child objects (Methods, Actions, Properties) now correctly identify and link to their parents even when created in the same import session.
- **Folder Path Integrity**: Fixed bug where new objects sometimes defaulted to the root; they now strictly follow the folder structure defined in the file system.
- **CSV Metadata Engine**: Switched to a CSV-backed metadata system for significantly faster data access and zero corruption risk from semicolons or special characters.
- **Git Hygiene**: Explicitly untracked local configuration files (`Project_parameters.py`, `Project_ImportSync.py`) and temporary files to keep repositories clean.

### Version 0.9.9-beta (2026-01-29)

**Major Storage Update:**
- **Split Metadata**: Replaced `_metadata.json` with `_config.json` (JSON) and `_metadata.csv` (CSV) for better performance and scalability.
- **Improved Hashing**: Unified ST content formatting ensures consistent hashes regardless of trailing whitespace.
- **Enhanced Debug Info**: Detailed import/export statistics and progress tracking in the CODESYS console.
- **NOTE**: Transitioning to this version requires a fresh export from the IDE. Clean your export folder before running `Project_export.py`.

### Version 0.9.8-beta (2026-01-29)

**New Features & Improvements:**
- **Orphan Cleanup (Export)**: `Project_export.py` now identifies files in the export directory that are no longer part of the CODESYS project and offers to delete them.
- **Deletion Sync (Import)**: `Project_import.py` now detects when files have been removed from disk and offers to delete the matching objects from the CODESYS IDE.
- **Empty Folder Management**: Automatic cleanup of empty directories during the export process.

### Version 0.9.7-beta (2026-01-20)

**New Features & Improvements:**
- **Function Return Types**: The import script now intelligently parses `FUNCTION` declarations to determine return types (including custom DUTs) and creates them correctly.
- **Property Accessors**: Added support for `Get.st` and `Set.st` files, ensuring they are correctly associated with their parent Properties.
- **Robust Type Detection**: Improved parsing logic to ignore comments and pragmas when determining object types, fixing issues with file headers.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved "Access Denied" errors by properly skipping directory checks in the file processing loop.

### Version 0.9.6-beta (2026-01-20)

**New Features:**
- **Full Folder Support**: The importer now creates new folder structures (nested directories) to match your file system.
- **New Object Creation**: You can create `.st` files externally, and they will be imported as new POUs, GVLs, or DUTs.
- **Child Object Support**: Methods, Actions, and Properties (e.g., `Parent.Child.st`) are now correctly identified and created under their parent POU.
- **Robust Import**: Implemented a two-pass import process (Parents then Children) to ensure 100% reliable object creation.

### Version 0.9.2-beta (2026-01-20)

**Major Refactoring:**
- Extracted common code into shared modules (`codesys_constants.py` and `codesys_utils.py`)
- Reduced code duplication by ~300 lines across 5 scripts
- Centralized CODESYS type GUIDs and constants
- Improved maintainability and consistency

**Bug Fixes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed `build_object_cache()` not finding objects when called from imported modules
  - Issue: Imported modules don't have access to CODESYS global variables (`projects`)
  - Solution: Modified function to accept project as parameter
  - Impact: Import and AutoSync now work correctly
- Updated all scripts to pass `projects.primary` to `build_object_cache()`

**New Files:**
- `codesys_constants.py` - Shared constants and type definitions
- `codesys_utils.py` - Shared utility functions
- `debug_metadata.py` - Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting
